# AuditSearcher
Look for keywords in Hacken SC audits

#### Usage:
node main.js "whatever you want to find"


#### Notes:
Audits have been gently (long sleeps) crawled from the public page https://hacken.io/audits/

Searches are case insensitive

This is not optimized: all PDFs get parsed at every search. They could be saved locally as text to make searches faster. I rarely use it so its fine to me.

Public audits have been synced on date 17/11/22. Further audits can be manually downloaded and put in audits folder.

Could be interesting to add another audits source
